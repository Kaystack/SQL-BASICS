# SQL-BASICS
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts and queries written by me as part of my SQL learning journey. These scripts demonstrate my understanding of SQL concepts and can be used as a reference for others who are also learning SQL.

# CONTENTS
Tutorial.sql - A script that creates a new database

Studentdemographics.sql - A SQL script that creates a table named StudentDemographics with columns for StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age, and Gender.

Insert_student_demographics.sql - A SQL script that inserts data into the StudentDemographics table.

Create_student_income.sql - A SQL script that creates a table named StudentIncome and inserts data into it.

# REQUIREMENTS
The code in this repository has been written using SQL and has been tested on SQL Server management studio. To run the scripts, you will need access to a SQL database manager and the appropriate credentials.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

$ git clone https://github.com/kaystack/sql-basics.git
